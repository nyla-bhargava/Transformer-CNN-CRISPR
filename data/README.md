## Datasets

This project uses two datasets:

1. **Proxy dataset**
   - Used for training and validation
   - Originally introduced by Park et al., Nature Biotechnology (2019)
   - File expected: `Proxy_TrainCV.csv`

2. **TrueOT dataset**
   - Used exclusively for external generalization evaluation
   - Originally introduced by Kim et al., Genome Biology (2020)
   - File expected: `TrueOT_1806uniqueTriplet_gRNA_OT_label.csv`

Due to file size and redistribution considerations, the datasets are not included
in this repository. Preprocessed versions used in our experiments can be downloaded
from the following Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1omL0lzEhMpFdZcwFsKlzBNSBs8_7NkCT?usp=sharing

The original datasets are available from their respective authors and publications.
Users may alternatively obtain the data directly from those original sources.

After downloading, place the files in this directory before running the code.
